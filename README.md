# Infoblox Playbooks for Splunk SOAR

This repository contains playbooks designed to automate security operations with Infoblox integrations on Splunk SOAR.  
The playbooks are organized into two categories:

- **Cloud** (Infoblox Threat Defense with DDI)  
- **On-premise** (Infoblox NIOS)  

These playbooks help security teams streamline workflows by automating enrichment, blocking/unblocking, vulnerability management, and incident response.

> For detailed configuration steps related to each integration and its playbooks, please refer to the **README file inside the respective integration folder** (`Infoblox Threat Defense with DDI/` or `Infoblox NIOS/`).
